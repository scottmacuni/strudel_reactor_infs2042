# Strudel Reactor
![App Home Page](./public/screenshots/app-home.png)

## Overview
This web application was developed as a part of the INFT 2064 Web Technology course work. 

It is a React Application which builds upon the Strudel.cc npm libraries to provide an interface for the user to orchestrate, play, and modify songs using the strudel syntax.

It features two feature panels which provide alternative ways to interact with the libraries and create sound effects.
1) Strudel REPL - the left panel features the traditional strudel REPL where you can write traditional strudel code to construct your songs.
2) Midi pad - the right panel features a midi pad drum machine which allows you to construct songs from layered sound loops, a no-code solution for interacting with strudel.
